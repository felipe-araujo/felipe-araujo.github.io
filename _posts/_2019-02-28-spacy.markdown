spaCy is a library for dealing with Natural Language Processing(NLP)

I first heard of it while dealing with a chatbot implementation with the RASA framerwork, and decided to give it a deeper look.

NLP encompasses many interesting problems. 

One can ask, for exemple,

- what is the role played by each word in a sentence;
- what are known entities - people's names, places, and so on;

One can also be interested in learning efficient representations for the words themselves. This is adrressed by the word embedding problem.

spaCy comes with pre-trained vectors for some languages, and using it is quite straightforward:


The first thing one can ask is how to 

$$
M = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
x_{11} & x_{12} & \ldots \\
x_{21} & x_{22} & \ldots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ldots \\
\end{array} \right)
$$

To reuse an existing directory, use the `--force` option:

{% highlight bash %}
jekyll new felipe-araujo.github.io --force
{% endhighlight %}

Push it to the master branch, and GitHub takes care of the rest.
